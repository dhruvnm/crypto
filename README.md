# crypto

## Overview
A program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages with various different ciphers

## Run crypto
To run crypto make sure you have the latest version of Python 3.
Make sure you are in the `crypto` directory and then run
```
python3 crypto.py
```

## Supported Ciphers
1. ROT47

    ROT47 will take every character as ASCII and shift it's value by 47 places. Since there are 94 valid ASCII characters, an encrypted   message can be decrypted by running ROT47 a second time.

2. Caesar Cipher
